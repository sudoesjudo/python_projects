# Lesson 3 Overview

This lesson focuses on flow control in Python using conditionals, loops, and list comprehensions.

## Topics Covered:
- **Conditionals:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control program logic.
- **Loops:** Iterating over data using `for` and `while` loops.
- **List Comprehensions (Optional):** Creating concise lists using comprehensions.
- **Generator Expressions (Optional):** Memory-efficient iteration using generators.

## Exercises:
1. **Advanced Subnet Calculator:**  
   - Calculate and print subnets based on a user-entered prefix length (25â€“30).  
   - Display the number of hosts, total subnets, and the first/last host in the first subnet.

2. **IP Address Parse and Extract:**  
   - Read from a file (`show_ip_int_brief.txt`).  
   - Identify and extract interface details for addresses in the "10.220" network.

These exercises help reinforce the use of loops, conditionals, and basic string operations.
