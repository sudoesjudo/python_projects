This repo will host what I am learning regarding Python and Network Automation.

## Introduction

Hi people. I am Aubin. I currently work in the NOC as a Network Technician. I am learning all sorts of things these days, and decided I wanted a place to track my progress while learning Python and Network Automation.
From abosulte basics to full on Network Automation. This will be a portfolio for my learning journey from starting as a beginner onwards towards expertise. I am excited to share this journey with the world. Hopefully I'll inspire a few to try out something new as well!

## How it works

I will add to this list over time as new things arise. Below is a list of dependencies and libraries needed for my scripts and programs.

### Dependencies

Within each lesson, there will be files used in the Python programs. 

#### Here is a fancy list of dependencies:
- python3.10+
- git (for version control, organization, and documenation)

### Libraries

Depending on the program, any of the below libraries might be used.

#### You may find it worth it to install the necessary libraries, etc:
- ipython==8.6.0
- pylama==8.4.1
- black==23.3.0
- rich==13.3.3
- netmiko==4.2.0
- emoji==2.2.0
