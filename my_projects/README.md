# My Personal Python Projects

This folder contains various Python projects that I’m working on outside of my coursework or professional projects. These are personal experiments, learning exercises, and ideas I’m developing in my own time.

## Overview

As I progress through my studies and explore new ideas, I will continue to add different scripts and projects to this directory. Each project will be self-contained and focus on different areas.

## Projects

### Python Scripts 🐍

| **Project Name**      | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Ping Script**       | A simple script that prompts the user to input an IP address and then pings it. It detects the operating system and executes the appropriate ping command for either Windows or Linux. |

### Bash Scripts ♻️

| **Project Name**      | **Description** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **Auto-Venv**    | A bash script to automate activating your specified virtual environment upon changing to a specified directory. Any time you 'cd' to your directory, the venv of your choice will be activated! |

## Future Projects 🚀🚀

In the future, I plan to add more projects related to network automation, system scripting, and other Python-based utilities. Stay tuned for more!
